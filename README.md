# Property Finder App
https://github.com/sheparddw/PropertyFinder

A React Native App for finding UK properties.
This App was originally created via a [tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial), but several changes were made to account for changes in the Nestoria and React Native APIs, for a better UX, and Nestoria API compliance.
